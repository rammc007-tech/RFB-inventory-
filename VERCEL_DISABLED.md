# Vercel Disabled

Vercel has been **disabled** to prevent failed deployment email notifications.

## What was done:
- ✅ Deleted `vercel.json` (prevents automatic deployments)
- ✅ Removed all `.vercel-*` trigger files
- ✅ Added `vercel.json` to `.gitignore`

## Current Deployment:
- **Railway**: Active (primary deployment platform)
- **Vercel**: Disabled (no more emails)

## To re-enable Vercel (if needed):
1. Create new `vercel.json` file
2. Reconnect GitHub repository in Vercel dashboard
3. Configure environment variables

**Note**: Railway is the active deployment platform. Vercel is locked/disabled.
